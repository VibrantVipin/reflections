this is the third lesson and we are learning about github.
In that we are doing push and also if file is present at github but not on local repository then what happen let's see.


When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1. when i am collborating with other people in a project
2. when i need to access my project from different computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because at some point of time i don't want to merge my code with others
by pulling manually i can keep track of my pull better



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork means clonening the repository but on github
clonening the repostitory means copying the history and file onto your local repository
branches would be used when you are making change but you are not sure to include it into main project.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
by having copy of last known state of remote stored locally , we can check or compare that is there any conflict in our commit and at remote side.
w can remove merge conflict easily.



When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
when i am working on a diferent feature and i do changes on my computer
