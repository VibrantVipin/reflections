this is the third lesson and we are learning about github.
In that we are doing push and also if file is present at github but not on local repository then what happen let's see.


When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1. when i am collborating with other people in a project
2. when i need to access my project from different computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because at some point of time i don't want to merge my code with others
by pulling manually i can keep track of my pull better



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork means clonening the repository but on github
clonening the repostitory means copying the history and file onto your local repository
branches would be used when you are making change but you are not sure to include it into main project.
